{"name":"Henry","tagline":"The PiZero powered bot","body":"### Welcome to the Henry github pages.\r\nHenry is a Raspberry Pi Zero powered robot with a simple web interface for remote control. Henry was inspired by PiWars and the Zerobot feature in MagPi Magazine Issue 40 (Pi Zero launch edition)\r\n\r\n### Basic Robot Components\r\nHenry uses most of the components featured in the zerobot article. Namely these are:\r\n* [Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) \r\n* [2 x 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motors](http://4tronix.co.uk/store/index.php?rt=product/product&path=65&product_id=196)\r\n* [2 x ULN2003A Motor Drivers](http://4tronix.co.uk/store/index.php?rt=product/product&path=65&product_id=196)\r\n\r\nIn addition to this Henry also uses:\r\n* [90 degree 40 pin header](http://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-essential-kit)\r\n* [Raspberry Pi WiFi Dongle](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/usb-wifi-dongle/)\r\n* [Henry desktop hoover](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Henry-Hetty-PP2500HH-Desktop-Cleaner/dp/B00KRG8BPS)\r\n* [Motor compatible wheels](http://4tronix.co.uk/store/index.php?rt=product/product&keyword=wheels&product_id=176)\r\n* [Mobile phone battery pack](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005QI1A8C)\r\n* various cables, nuts bolts etc.\r\n\r\n### ZeroBot\r\nThe [Zerobot](https://github.com/topshed/ZeroBot) tutorial was the starting point for me and this project. In addition to the Pi Zero it uses two stepper motors via driver boards and an HC-SR04 sensor to drive/walk around a set path unless it detects an obstacle. \r\nThis is great but after attending PiWars in Cambridge I knew I wanted some form of manual control. I have other plans for a more complicated robot with playstation controller etc but for Henry I wanted to keep it simple and so decided on a web interface. At some point in the future maybe i'll add some more automation too.\r\n\r\n### Flask Web Server\r\nTO DO: Describe Flask and it's usage\r\n\r\n### Updating ZeroBot Code\r\netc\r\n\r\n### Future development ideas\r\n* Inactivity 'wander about'\r\n* Add the HC-SR04 sensor in\r\n* Line following setup\r\n* lights, sound... aesthetics\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
